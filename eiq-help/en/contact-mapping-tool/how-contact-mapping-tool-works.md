# How Contact Mapping Tool Works?

The Contact Mapping Tool uses a rules-based, computerized data processing mechanism to assist you in mapping your contact names with other fields across databases and enables you to find a specific contact or contacts accurately using a multi-field search or search criteria.

Though the tool uses a powerful mechanism to search, there are limitations to what the tool can do. When the entered data is inconsistent with the same name or any other field spelled differently between records and databases, it becomes difficult to find the data that you want. In such cases, the tool:

- Pre-processes the data.
- Normalizes the data by way of removing duplicates and redundant data.
- Eliminates irrelevant records based on the search criteria.
- Presents a lesser number of records it cannot eliminate for further processing .
- Sorts and presents the data in the required format.
- Enables human screening and deciphering the records that are relevant and not eliminated.
