# Introduction to Contact Mapping Tool

Databases are growing in size and complexity by the day. Framing the search terms and queries to search a database is also getting complex and difficult.

Consider a scenario where you are tasked to search a list of names and associated email addresses and company names that could potentially have millions of records. The following could be a few  issues that you might face:

- The names that you search might be in different databases.
- The related information might be present in different databases. For example, names and emails could be in one database and the company names could be in another database.
- Each database might contain millions of records and you might not know the scope of your effort.
- You cannot be certain about the number of records present for the names that you are searching and whether you have found all the instances.
- The names in your list and fields in the databases might not be exactly the same and might be inconsistent. For example, the names in the list that you have might be nicknames, Mike or Mick for Michael, or sometimes, the first name might sound like a nickname, as in, Mike Portsworth.

The complexity of searching and matching the associated data increases with the number of people entering that data into the databases or other sources that are fed to the databases. When more people enter the data, chances are that they are inconsistent in entering the data and there are variations between different databases for the same set of information, leading to an increased time and effort in searching names and other related fields like emails and company names, within and across databases.

The Contact Mapping Tool offers a solution to you in such scenarios, where searching a related set of information becomes tedious.
