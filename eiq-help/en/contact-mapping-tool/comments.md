# Malar’s Comments and Questions

The intent of this content is unclear and I would clarify the following from the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Once I get to know the product and the technology, I should have the necessary information to take a call independently and would not seek help from SMEs unnecessarily.

- What is the intent and who is it written for?
- What is the scope of this document?
- Is this about the Contact Mapping Tool or generally about optimizing search in databases? I would decide the heading and narrative based on that. I have written a few sections with the scope of the tool as contact mapping as the name suggests though the content doesn’t establish that.
- Confirm the name of the tool: Contact Mapping Tool. Is the focus on Contacts and Mapping only?
- Is the scope of the tool restricted to databases only? What type of database and what could be the size? Instead of vague numbers like “millions of records”, if possible, provide some context and relatable and precise numbers.
- Is it a search tool or a query tool?

**Will seek help from SMEs to:**

- Standardize terminologies and content. For example, normalizing encompasses removing duplication, the term, “matching” is used in a confusing way.
- Check if the tool is mapping something.
- Clarify if the tool actually does “data processing”.
- Remove contradicting and conflicting information. For example, “The complexity of the matching and searching of the data is directly proportional to the amount of human involvement in the processing of said data”.
- Make the problem statement and the intended solution clearer. It is not clearly stated what the tool actually does and what it is “mapping”. For example, "The list that you have and that you are searching should have the names, emails, and company names mapped". Does the tool search for combinations of names, email addresses, companies and so forth? The tool cannot address the issue of the inconsistency in humans feeding the data into the database. Example: "the more people create the data, the more variations and differences there can be".
- If information is present in different databases, there should be a key field that connects all. We cannot say that the tool will address that. We should have the problem statement correct.
- How the tool matches the names with other fields within a database and across databases and how it decides it is a match?
- How the tool eliminates the records and how it is foolproof.
- Explain an actual use case and provide that in the document as appropriate.
