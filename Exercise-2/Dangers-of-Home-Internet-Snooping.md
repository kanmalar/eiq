# What Is Home Internet Connection Snooping?

Your home Internet Connection can be vulnerable to snooping by miscreants who can then gain access to:

- Your network
- Files on the connected devices within that network
- Apps in your phone and other devises
- Your bank account and credit card details
- Your usernames and passwords

Snooping could potentially occur when you allow your guests to connect to your home Wi-Fi network, or when you leave your Wi-Fi network open. Anyone who has access to your home Wi-Fi SSID can gain access to your network if it is open and discoverable.

# How to Mitigate Wi-Fi Snooping Risks?

This section describes how to mitigate potential risks arising from Wi-Fi snooping.

## Encrypt your Wi-Fi Router

When you encrypt your Wi-Fi router, it becomes very difficult for a snooper to gain access to your device through an open network. Avoid WEP and use WPA or WPA2 to secure your network in your router and ensure that make sure that all the devices that need to access your network can use it. WPA2 is the most secure option. Most of the latest routers have WPA2 enabled by default. For more information about encrypting your Wi-Fi network, see, [Wi-Fi Protected Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access).

**Note:** Device OS vulnerabilities might allow snoopers to completely bypass router encryption.

## Change the Router Administrator Credentials Periodically

Change your default router administrator password and username regularly. Ensure to change the default administrator usernames and passwords of routers. They are widely known and can be used by anyone.

## Disable SSID Broadcasting

A Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies your Wi-Fi network. It usually is named in a way to easily identify you or your network and your router broadcasts it. If a snooper knows the SSID, and can see it, the snooper can break into your network. Rename the default SSID and then disable SSID broadcasting so that your Wi-Fi is not visible to others.

## Set MAC Address Filtering

You can setup your network to allow only devices that you authorize to connect using MAC address filtering. Every device that connects to your Wi-Fi network has a unique MAC address.

## Avoid Risky Apps

Do not install or use vulnerable or dubious apps in your devices. Ensure that the apps are secure and are from reputed developers.
